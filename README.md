# rmanbackup
Generic enough script for Oracle RMAN backups

This is essentially a collection of Oracle RMAN (receovery manager) scripts I used over time in most of the projects, where there was no specific need for a tailored solution, like section-based backups of big files, slow backup disks, restrictive backup windows etc, combined into a single script.
